# ImageGalleryusingPHP
Designed a website for Image Gallery in PHP using MVC. Program scans for all the folders in a directory and displays thumbnails for that folder on the website, which on clicked open up the directory which in the end displays all the images from that folder.  All in all, website is dynamically in a way that user can have as many directories and have as many images in each directory and the program would read all the directories with the images beneath it.
